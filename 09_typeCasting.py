# Typecasting is the technique of converting a datatype into other datatype. It provides various functions like int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), list(), dict(), set(), tuple(), etc. All of these functions will try to convert the variable of one type into  other.
# 1. Implicit typecasting: automatically done by python.
# 2. Explicit typecasting: done by the developer forcefully.

a = "1"
b = "2"

print
print(int(a) + int(b))
