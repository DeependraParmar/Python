# We also have some of the sequenced datatypes like lists and tuples
# 1. lists are ordered, mutable collection of data with elements seperated with comma enclosed in []
# 1. lists are ordered, immutable collection of data with elements seperated with comma enclosed in ()


# We also have a mapped datatype Dictionary that is the collection of key value pairs in {}
